Serverless REST API with DynamoDB backend

RESTful API with AWS API Gateway integration allowing POST requests using curl.
The API calls a lambda function that parses the POST resource and inserts object into DynamoDB table

To test you can open API Gateway > Select the API > Resources > POST > Test
Or you can run the following command:

curl -v -X POST "https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test/employee" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
"employee_id": "c12345",
"name": "John Smith",
"business_unit": "BU4",
"cubicle_no": 6
}'
